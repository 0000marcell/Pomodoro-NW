all the wiring between the model and the view goes in
the controller

routes:
all data is loaded in the routes, no actions reside on the route

views:
views are just used to call a function that loads something
on the controller, using the didInsertElement rook

model: has some functions related to the data, saving loading etc 

the helper has some helper objects, some list transformations are made 
using those 

helpers:
aws_helper.js, not used anywhere  
bar-chart.js, part of the logic to build the bar chart 
clock_helper.js, only used in tha main, i can remove this with some modifications

move this logic to a controller or ember.object representing the clock
