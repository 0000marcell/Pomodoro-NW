Simple pomodoro tracker app for mac, linux and windows made using web technologies:
* ember
* NW.js
* Node.js
the app can be packed to any of the system mentioned using nw.js (A.K.A nodewebkit) 
i've also used flipclock http://flipclockjs.com/

### Issues 
* there's still a lot of work do to, mainly in the config and statistic parts of the app
* formating and spacing in the statistics view 
* better way to point to an external file to save your progress
